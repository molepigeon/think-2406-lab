# Securing your IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service workloads with IBM Cloud Container Registry

![Session 2406 at Think 2019](https://www.ibm.com/events/shared/img/think2019/think-2019-branding-footer.jpg)

## Objectives

To learn you cloud and stuff! Specifically, the parts about getting your stuff into a cloud Kubernetes cluster, and operating it once it's there.

## Audience

Although prior experience of operating Kubernetes and using command line tools would be beneficial, this session is suitable for any user who wishes to learn how to use IBM Cloud tools to secure Kubernetes workloads.

## Session structure

The session is comprised of a number of exercises focused around the tool that you'll be using. The exercises build upon one another, and sometimes it is assumed that you have everything from the previous exercises set up, so it's best to complete the exercises in order. The simplest way to navigate this tutorial is the **Next** and **Previous** buttons at the bottom of each page, but you can also click a particular section in the sidebar to jump to it.

## Help

If you're completing the steps for this tutorial in the scheduled slot at the Think 2019 onference, feel free to ask any of the IBMers for assistance or for more information about a particular section.

If you're completing the steps at the conference, but outside the slot, the friendly faces at the IBM Cloud booth or the open lab classroom have contact information for the speakers and can pass on your questions.

If you're not at Think 2019, or you're finishing this tutorial after the conference, you can contact the speakers by using the #container-registry channel in the [IBM Kubernetes Service Slack](https://bxcs-slack-invite.mybluemix.net/).
