# Monitoring and securing your IBM Kubernetes workloads in IBM Cloud

As the complexity of cloud architecture increases and the focus shifts more towards security, your organization faces new challenges when managing applications, services, and the cloud infrastructure itself.

As a result, your use of traditional logging and monitoring tools is not enough. Furthermore, how quickly can your DevOps teams identify and resolve problems with traditional methods? What happens as the number of hosts and applications grow exponentially over time and the infrastructure becomes too complex to manage? How do you ensure that you trust the code that's running in your production environment, that it's vulnerability free, and that it hasn't been tampered with by malicious third parties?

In this lab, you will learn about IBMÂ® Cloud Container Registry , IBM Log Analysis with LogDNA, and IBM Cloud Monitoring with Sysdig. Find out how you can use these services to gain operational visibility of your Kubernetes clusters, and how you can use content trust and vulnerability scanning in IBM Cloud Container Registry to ensure that your workloads are correct and vulnerability free before deploying them.

## Agenda

The lab is divided into three parts:

* Part 1: Securing your IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service workloads with IBM Cloud Container Registry
* Part 2: Cluster-level logging by using IBM Log Analysis with LogDNA
* Part 3: Monitoring a Kubernetes cluster in IBM Cloud by using IBM Cloud Monitoring with Sysdig

## Audience

Although prior experience of operating Kubernetes and using command line tools would be beneficial, this session is suitable for any user who wishes to learn how to use IBM Cloud tools to secure Kubernetes workloads.

## Session structure

The session is comprised of a number of exercises focused around each of the services that you'll be using. 

The simplest way to navigate this tutorial is the **Next** and **Previous** buttons at the bottom of each page, but you can also click a particular section in the sidebar to jump to it.

**Note: Each section (part) of the lab is designed to be independent from the others. Therefore, you can start with any section of the lab.**

## Help

If you're completing the steps for this tutorial in the scheduled slot at the Think 2019 conference, feel free to ask any of the IBMers for assistance or for more information about a particular section.

If you're completing the steps at the conference, but outside the slot, the friendly faces at the IBM Cloud booth or the open lab classroom have contact information for the speakers and can pass on your questions.

If you're not at Think 2019, or you're finishing this tutorial after the conference, you can contact the speakers by using the #container-registry channel in the [IBM Kubernetes Service Slack](https://bxcs-slack-invite.mybluemix.net/).
