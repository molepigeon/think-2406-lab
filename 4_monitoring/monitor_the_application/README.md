# Monitor the application {#monitor-the-application}

This sample application is HTTP based.

IBM Cloud Monitoring with Sysdig includes different pre-defined metrics and default dashboards that you can use to diagnose and assess the performance of the application.

When you monitor an application, you should consider:

## Monitoring the health of the application

* The health signals coming from hardware and software components

* Utilization, Saturations and Errors (USE): resource usage and capacity limits, CPU, memory, disk I/O, network against host or container limits

## Monitoring the golden signals that focus on perceived service quality

* Latency of HTTP calls, both average and worst case ones

* Traffic, that is, rate of requests per second

* Errors and their frequency

In the next steps, you will learn how to use dashboards and metrics to monitor the health of your application.
