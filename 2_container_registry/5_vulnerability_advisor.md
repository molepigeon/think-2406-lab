# Viewing vulnerability information about your images

In this section, you will use Vulnerability Advisor to scan your image. Vulnerability Advisor compares the packages in your image against lists of known vulnerabilities, and allows you to view a report on your image. You can define policies to control whether an image should be allowed to be deployed to your cluster, which you will experience in a later section.

## Viewing your image in Vulnerability Advisor

Open the IBM Cloud console.

Go to the web UI, find the image we pushed in the onboarding section

Explore some vulnerabilities

Push alpine:latest with a different image name (IMPORTANT! Because we need the vulnerable image later so that CISE can block it!)

Show that the alpine:latest image is clean in VA.
