# Viewing vulnerability information about your images

Intro to VA

Go to the web UI, find the image we pushed in the onboarding section

Explore some vulnerabilities

Push alpine:latest with a different image name (IMPORTANT! Because we need the vulnerable image later so that CISE can block it!)

Show that the alpine:latest image is clean in VA.
