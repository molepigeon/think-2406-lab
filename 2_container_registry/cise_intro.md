# Enforcing security in your cluster

With Container Image Security Enforcement, you can verify your container images before you deploy them to your cluster in IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service. You can control where images are deployed from, enforce Vulnerability Advisor policies, and ensure that content trust is properly applied to the image. If an image does not meet your policy requirements, the pod is not deployed to your cluster or updated.

**Note:** This section will add another 30 minutes to the duration of this part of the tutorial. If you would like enough time to explore the Logging and Monitoring parts in detail during the session, you should consider skipping this section and returning if you have time once you have completed those parts.
