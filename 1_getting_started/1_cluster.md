# Getting Started

In this section, you will create your own IBM Cloud account, and then get access to a IBM Cloud Lab account which contains pre-provisioned clusters. Each lab attendee will be granted access to one cluster.

1. Create your own [IBM Cloud account](https://cloud.ibm.com).
2. After the email verification, confirm by logging in to <https://cloud.ibm.com>.
3. Go to [Get Cluster](https://get-cluster.mybluemix.net) web page and enter your IBM ID (the email you used to sign up) and the lab key `wrong`. Unless instructed otherwise, choose the **US South** region.
